# 	Application Modernization - Hackathon

Welcome to the Modernize Applications to be AI-ready Hackathon! Today, you are set to dive into the transformative world of AI, focusing on utilizing the power of Azure OpenAI services. Explore cutting-edge tools, frameworks, and best practices to transform legacy systems into agile, scalable, and efficient modern applications. Brace yourself for a day of immersive learning, hands-on experience, and innovation that will empower you to redefine how applications are designed and deployed.

## Introduction

Your quest is to modernize for the future at the fictitious enterprise GenTech Inc. Your challenge? To transform GenTech's legacy systems into state-of-the-art, scalable, and efficient applications, driving operational excellence and superior customer experiences through innovative modernization strategies.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Gain practical experience deploying and managing Azure OpenAI services, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Deploy and evaluate a legacy application (Contoso Hotel app) to identify areas for modernization.
- Repackage and modernize application components to create an updated, scalable deployment.
- Set up Azure resources to extract and process data from external sources, such as hotel brochures.
- Seamlessly integrate a chatbot with the Contoso Hotel application for enhanced user interactions.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills by addressing real-world scenarios with AI-driven solutions.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based
This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with practical problems. Each challenge includes one or more self-contained tasks designed to test and enhance your skills in specific aspects of AI app development. You will approach these challenges by:

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and Azure AI services.

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**

   - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.

1. **Challenge 02: Deploy and Utilize NVIDIA Riva ASR on Azure**

   - Deploy and utilize NVIDIA Riva ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) on an Azure GPU-enabled virtual machine. You will generate the necessary NVIDIA API keys, create and connect to a GPU-enabled Azure virtual machine, and then set up and run the NVIDIA Riva ASR container.

1. **Challenge 03: Deploy and review the legacy Contoso Hotel app**

   -  Deploy the legacy app to a Docker container and then run the container. You will provision a PostgreSQL database instance on Azure. You will set up and review the app and then test it by adding a new booking.

1. **Challenge 04: Split and repackage the Contoso Hotel app components and deploy the updated app**

   - You will split the components and refactor some code. Then, you will deploy the front-end and back-end components to separate containers. Finally, you will push the containers to ACR and run the updated app.   

1. **Challenge 05: Set up Azure resources and extract data from hotel brochures**

   - You will upload PDF versions of the Contoso Hotel brochures to an Azure Storage account. Then, you will use the Azure Search service and the Azure OpenAI service to scan the PDFs and extract information that a chatbot can use to respond to guest inquiries.

1. **Challenge 06: Configure an AI Hub and Prompt Flow**

   - You will use Prompt Flow within Azure AI Studio. Azure OpenAI Prompt Flow is a development tool designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt Flow simplifies the process of prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and deploying AI applications.   

1. **Challenge 07: Integrate the chatbot with the Contoso Hotel application**   

   - In this challenge, you will integrate the chatbot into the updated Contoso Hotel application by setting up Visual Studio Code to run the chatbot flow locally, then deploy it to Azure Container Apps, and test its integration with the Contoso Hotel application to enhance user interaction capabilities.

Each challenge comes with its own set of tasks and objectives. Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact your coach.

Happy hacking!
