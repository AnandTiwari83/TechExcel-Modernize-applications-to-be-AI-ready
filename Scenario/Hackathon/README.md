# 	App Modernization - Hackathon

Welcome to the Modernize Applications to be AI-ready Hackathon! Today, you're set to dive into the transformative world of AI, with a focus on utilizing the power of Azure OpenAI services. You'll explore cutting-edge tools, frameworks, and best practices to transform legacy systems into agile, scalable, and efficient modern applications. Brace yourself for a day of immersive learning, hands-on experience, and innovation that will empower you to redefine the way applications are designed and deployed.

## Introduction

Your quest is to modernize for the future at the fictitious enterprise, GenTech Inc. Your challenge? To transform GenTech's legacy systems into state-of-the-art, scalable, and efficient applications, driving operational excellence and superior customer experiences through innovative modernization strategies.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Gain practical experience in deploying and managing Azure OpenAI services, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Deploy and evaluate a legacy application (Contoso Hotel app) to identify areas for modernization.
- Repackage and modernize application components to create an updated, scalable deployment.
- Set up Azure resources to extract and process data from external sources, such as hotel brochures.
- Seamlessly integrate a chatbot with the Contoso Hotel application for enhanced user interactions.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills by addressing real-world scenarios with AI-driven solutions.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based
This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with practical problems. Each challenge includes one or more self-contained tasks designed to test and enhance your skills in specific aspects of AI app development. You will approach these challenges by:

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and Azure AI services.

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**

   - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.

1. **Challenge 02: Deploy and review the legacy Contoso Hotel app**

   -  Deploy the legacy app to a Docker container and then run the container. You’ll provision a PostgreSQL database instance on Azure. You’ll set up and review the app, and then test the app by adding a new booking.

1. **Challenge 03: Split and repackage the Contoso Hotel app components and deploy the updated app**

   - You’ll split the components and refactor some code. Then, you’ll deploy the front-end and back-end components to separate containers. Finally, you’ll push the containers to ACR and run the updated app.   

1. **Challenge 04: Set up Azure resources and extract data from hotel brochures**

   - You’ll upload PDF versions of the Contoso Hotel brochures to an Azure Storage account. Then, you’ll use Azure Search service and Azure OpenAI service to scan the PDFs and extract information that a chatbot can use to respond to guest inquiries.

1. **Challenge 05: Configure an AI Hub and Promptflow**

   - You’ll use Prompt Flow within Azure AI Studio. Azure OpenAI Prompt Flow is a development tool designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt Flow simplifies the process of prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and deploying AI applications.   

1. **Challenge 06: Integrate the chatbot with the Contoso Hotel application**   

   - In this challenge, you will integrate the chatbot into the updated Contoso Hotel application by you setting up Visual Studio Code to run the chatbot flow locally, then deploy it to Azure Container Apps and test its integration with the Contoso Hotel application to enhance user interaction capabilities.

Each challenge comes with its own set of tasks and objectives. Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your coach.

Happy hacking!
