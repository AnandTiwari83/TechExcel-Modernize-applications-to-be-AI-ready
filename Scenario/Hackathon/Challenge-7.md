2. Create and Connect to a GPU-Enabled Virtual Machine in Azure

   - **Create a GPU Virtual Machine** : Select **NVIDIA GPU-Optimized VMI with vGPU driver - v22.08.0 - x64 Gen 2** as the image and Choose **NC4as_T4_v3** as the VM size

   - **Configure Storage**: Set **OS disk size** to **128 GiB** and Select **Standard SSD (locally-redundant storage)** as the OS disk type and create

   - **Connect to the VM**: Connected to the GPU Virtual Machine using SSH

3. Set Up and Run NVIDIA Riva ASR Container

   - Set up the NVIDIA Container Toolkit by adding your user to the docker group:
      
      ```bash
      sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
      
      # Apply changes (logout/login required)
      newgrp docker
      ```

   - Configure your NGC API Key:

      ```bash
      # Set your NGC API Key (replace with your actual key)
      export NGC_API_KEY="your-ngc-api-key"

      # Add to shell configuration for persistence
      echo "export NGC_API_KEY=your-ngc-api-key" >> ~/.bashrc

      # Log in to NGC container registry
      echo "$NGC_API_KEY" | docker login nvcr.io --username '$oauthtoken' --password-stdin
      ```

   - Run the NVIDIA Riva ASR Container:
      
      ```bash
      # Set model selector
      export NIM_TAGS_SELECTOR="name=parakeet-1-1b-ctc-riva-en-us,mode=all"

      # Run the container
      docker run -it --rm --name=riva-asr \
         --gpus '"device=0"' \
         --shm-size=8GB \
         -e NGC_API_KEY \
         -e NIM_HTTP_API_PORT=9000 \
         -e NIM_GRPC_API_PORT=50051 \
         -p 9000:9000 \
         -p 50051:50051 \
         -e NIM_TAGS_SELECTOR \
         nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/riva-asr:1.3.0
      ```

      > **Note**: It may take up to 30 minutes for the Docker container to be ready and start accepting requests, depending on your network speed.

   - Once the NVIDIA Riva ASR deployment is succeeded, Open a new terminal Connect to the VM and run the following command to check if the service is ready to handle inference requests.

     ```
     curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:9000/v1/health/ready'
     ```

   - If the service is ready, you get a response similar to the following.

     ```
     {"status":"ready"}

4: Configure Network Security Group Rules for External Access

   - In the **Network Security Groups (NSG)**, configure **Inbound Security Rules** to allow traffic for the hackathon setup:  

      - Open port `9000` with the `TCP` protocol and set the priority to `100`.  
      - Open port `50551` with the `TCP` protocol and set the priority to `101`.  

   - Open a new tab in the browser and navigate to the following URL to verify if the service is ready to handle inference requests.

      ```
      http://<nvidia-gpu-public-ip>:9000/v1/health/ready
      ```

## Success Criteria:

- Successfully generated an NGC API key from NVIDIA and verified account access.
- Verify the successful deployment of the Virtual Machine with SKU size of **Standard NC4as T4 v3** and disk size of **Standard SSD LRS 128 GiB**.
- Successfully deployed the NVIDIA Riva ASR.
- Configured Network Security Group rules to open ports 9000 and 50551
- Verified the Riva ASR service is running and accessible by checking the health endpoint
  both locally and remotely via browser (http://<nvidia-gpu-public-ip>:9000/v1/health/ready).
