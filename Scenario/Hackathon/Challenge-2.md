# Challenge 03: Deploy and Review the Legacy Contoso Hotel App
### Estimated Time: 45 Minutes
## Introduction

The legacy Contoso Hotel app was written using Python code. App components run inside a Docker container. The app can connect to a SQL Server or PostgreSQL database (on-premises or online).

In this challenge, you will deploy a legacy application to a Docker container and run it successfully. The process begins with building a Docker container for the application by creating a Docker image. Next, you will create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance to securely store and manage the app’s container image before pushing the image to the registry. To support the application, you will provision a managed PostgreSQL database instance on Azure, ensuring the app has the necessary backend for data storage. Finally, you will run the containerized application, review its functionality, and test it by adding a new booking. This challenge provides hands-on experience with Docker, Azure Container Registry, and PostgreSQL while working on a practical deployment scenario.

Here's a simple overview of each service used by the app:

- **Docker:** Docker is an open-source platform that automates application deployment, scaling, and management. It uses containerization technology to package an application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed, private Docker registry service provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to store and manage container images and artifacts in a secure and scalable manner.
- **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It’s known for its robustness, extensibility, and standards compliance. Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server is a fully managed database service designed to provide more granular control and flexibility over database management functions and configuration settings.


## Challenge Objectives:

> **Important**: When deploying services in this challenge, please make sure to use the resource group named **Appmod**. 

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository within Visual Studio Code: `https://github.com/qxsch/ContosoHotel.git`.
     > **Hint**: You can utilize the following repository, https://github.com/qxsch/ContosoHotel.git, to explore and perform the scenarios listed below.   

1. **Build a Docker Container for the App:**

   - Launch Docker Desktop. Verify that the Docker engine is running.   
   - Builds the container for the app within the **ContosoHotel** folder, where the cloned repository resides.

1. **Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) Instance and Push the App Container to ACR:**

   - Create an ACR instance with a basic SKU within the **Appmod** resource group inside the **ContosoHotel** folder.
   - Sign in to ACR. Create a Docker tag for the app and then push the app container to ACR.

1. **Provision a PostgreSQL Database to Support the App:**   

   - Run the **Connect-AzAccount** cmdlet to connect Visual Studio Code to Azure with an authenticated account.
   - Run the **manageIac.ps1** script from the **ContosoHotel\iac** folder to deploy an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server instance.
   > **Note**: Use the same region you used in Challenge 1.  
   > **Note**: Make sure to use the **Appmod** resource group.

     <validation step="f093ed04-190b-4416-bd7a-59a113e42a4e" />   

1. **Run the Containerized App and Add a Booking:**

   - Run the containerized app on port 8000.
   - Paste the following URL `http://localhost:8000/setup` in a web browser.
   - Run the setup process in the app to add records to the database.
   - Review the app pages.
   - Add the booking record.
   - Verify that the new record is saved and close the browser window.

## Success Criteria:

- Verify that the Docker engine is running.
- You have built a Docker container for the app.
- Created an Azure Container Registry instance.
- You have pushed the app container to ACR.
- You have provisioned an Azure Database for the PostgreSQL Flexible Server instance.
- You can view the app in a web browser.
- You can add a booking record to the app and verify that the record is saved and is searchable.
