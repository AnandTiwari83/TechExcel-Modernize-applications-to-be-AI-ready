# Exercise 04 - Set up Azure resources and extract data from hotel brochures

## Lab Scenario

When people are making travel plans, they often select a hotel based on the location of the hotel or the amenities that the hotel offers. Most hotel websites make it easy to search their hotels by date and location. However, it it can be challenging to narrow down the list so that only hotels with specific amenities display.

Contoso wants to build a chatbot that helps potential guests find a hotel that meets their needs. For this solution, you will upload PDF versions of the Contoso Hotel brochures to an Azure Storage account. Then, you will use Azure Search service and Azure OpenAI service to scan the PDFs and extract information that a chatbot can use to respond to guest inquiries.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Create an Azure Blob Storage accountand a storage container
- Upload hotel brochures to the storage container
- Create an Azure Search Service instance
- Create an Azure OpenAI service instance and deploy models to the instance
- Configure managed identities for the services
- Extract data from the brochures and test the search index

## Exercise Duration

Estimated time to complete this exercise: *45 minutes*

# Task 01 - Create Azure services

<!--- Estimated time: 7 minutes---> 

## Introduction

You can use Azure Blob Storage to contain the brochures for the hotels. Storing the brochures in Azure Blob Storage ensures that the brochures are available for searching by Azure Search Service.

Azure AI services is a set of cloud-based APIs that you can use in AI applications and data flows. This lab uses Azure OpenAI Service and Azure Search Service to scan and index the data from the hotel brochures. 

Azure OpenAI services allows you to deploy a variety of large language models so that you can enhance applications by adding AI capabilities.

## Description

In this task, you will create an Azure Blog Storage account and then upload a set of PDF files to the storage account. Each PDF file is a brochure for one of the hotels represented in the Contoso Hotels app. Then, you will provision an Azure Search Service instance. Finally, you will provision an Azure OpenAI service instance and deploy models to the instance. 

The key steps are as follows:

1. Create an Azure Storage account and container.
1. Download the folder which containst the hotel brochures to your local machine.
1. Upload the brochures to the storage container.
1. Create an Azure Search Service instance.
1. Provision Azure OpenAI Service and deploy GPT-4o and Text-Embedding-ADA-002 models.


## Success Criteria

- You have uploaded the hotel brochures to the container in the Azure Storage account. 
- You have created an Azure Search Service instance.
- You have deployed GPT-4o and Text-Embedding-ADA-002 to Azure OpenAI service.

# Task 02 - Configure managed identities for deployed Azure resources

<!--- Estimated time: 5 minutes---> 

## Introduction

Managing permissions and access for users and Azure resources can be challenging. Managed identities help you deploy secure solutions on Azure without the need to manage credentials. You can create system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities. For this lab, you will use system-assgined managed identities. You enable this type of identity directly on the Aure resource.

## Description

In this task, you will create a set of managed identities so that the various Azure resources you created can communicate with each other.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Configure the Azure OpenAI and Azure Search instances to use system-assigned managed identities.
1. Configure a managed identity to allow the Azure Search and Azure OpenAI instances to access the Azure Blob Storage account.
1. Configure a  managed identity to allow Azure Search instance to access the Azure OpenAI Service instance.
1. Configure a  managed identity to allow Azure OpenAI Service instance to access the  Azure Search instance.

## Success Criteria

- You have configured managed identities so that the Azure Blob Storage account, Azure Search Service instance, and Azure OpenAI Service instance can communicate with each other.

# Task 03 - Configure Azure Search to extract data from the brochures and test the search index

<!--- Estimated time: 10 minutes---> 

## Introduction

Azure Search Service includes a wizard that allows you to import and vectorize data. You will use the wizard to extract and vectorize data from the hotel brochures. As part of the wizard, you will create an Azure OpenAI Service instance and deploy models to the instance. You will use these models later in the lab to build the chatbot that lets visitors ask questions about hotels.

## Description

In this task, you will use Azure Search to import and vectorize data from the hotel brochures. You will then test the index.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Launch the import and vectorize data and connect to Azure Blob Storage.
1. Create an Azure OpenAI Service instance and deploy models to the instance.
1. Vectorize text from the brochures.
1. Index the data.
1. Test the index.

## Success Criteria

- You have successfully completed all steps in the Import and vectorize data wizard. 
- You have deployed models to an Azure OpenAI instance.
- You have tested the search index by using Search Explorer and can view results.
