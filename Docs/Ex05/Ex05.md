# Exercise 05 - Configure an AI Hub and Promptflow

There are a lot of ways to create a chatbot. For this lab, you will use Promptflow within Azure AI Studio. Azure OpenAI Prompt Flow is a development tool designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt Flow simplifies the process of prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and deploying AI applications.

## **What you will learn**

After completing the tasks in this exercise, you will be able to:

- Create a postgresql readonly user
- Create and configure an AI Hub instance
- Import a pre-built flow into PromptFlow
- Configure and test the flow

## Exercise Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes



## Task 01 - Create a postgresql user and set up an AI Hub and PromptFlow

<!--- Estimated time: 20 minutes---> 

### Introduction

An Azure AI Studio Hub is a central resource within Azure AI Studio that helps teams manage, collaborate, and organize their AI projects. 

### Description

In this task, you will create a hub and then create a project within the hub. You will also create a PostgreSQL user so the that flow can access the database records.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Create a user for the PostgreSQL database that allows the chatbot read-only access to the Hotels, Visitors, and Bookings tables.
1. Set up and configure an AI Studio Hub.
1. Create a project in the hub.


### Success Criteria

- You have successfully created a user in the PostgreSQL database
- You have created a new AI Studio Hub and created a project

### Learning Resources

- [**Secure Azure Database for PostgreSQL**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/secure-azure-database-for-postgresql/)

<summary>Expand this section to view the solution</summary>

1.  Open a browser window and go to [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com).

1.  Search for and select the PostgreSQL database that you created in a previous exercise.

    ![hlodbtra.png](../../media/hlodbtra.png)

1.  On the menu bar for the database server, select **Cloud Shell** and then select **Bash** in the Clous Shell pane.

    ![gpk0nqqq.png](../../media/gpk0nqqq.png)

1.  Select your subscription from the dropdown list and then select **Apply**.

1.  Replace the value for *POSTGRESQL_SERVERNAME* with the Server name that appears in the Overview section for your database server. Then, enter the following commands at the Cloud Shell prompt. These commands connect to the database.

    ```
    export PGHOST="POSTGRESQL_SERVERNAME"
    export PGUSER="contosoadmin"
    export PGPORT="5432"
    export PGDATABASE="pycontosohotel"
    export PGPASSWORD="myLittleSecret111!!!"
    psql
    ```

1.  Enter the following SQL statement at the Cloud Shell prompt. This statement creates a read-only user for the Promptflow chatbot:
    
    ```
    CREATE USER promptflow WITH PASSWORD '1234ABCD!';
    ```

1.  Enter the following SQL statementz at the Cloud Shell prompt. These statements grant the user access to the database tables.
    
    ```
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE hotels TO promptflow;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE bookings TO promptflow;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE visitors TO promptflow;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION getroomsusagewithintimespan TO promptflow;
    ```

    ![qq3r508d.png](../../media/qq3r508d.png)

1.  Return to Visual Studio Code. Enter the following command at the Terminal window prompt. This command creates a unique name for an AI Hub.

    ```
    $AI_HUB_NAME="ai-hub$(Get-Random -Minimum 100000 -Maximum 999999)"
    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green  "AI Hub name is: " $AI_HUB_NAME

## Task 02 - Import and configure a flow

<!--- Estimated time: 40 minutes---> 

### Introduction

A flow encapsulates the logic that tells the chatbot what it can do and how to do things. Creating a flow can be complicated. For this lab, you will use a pre-built flow. The flow uses the OpenAI API to directly query the Azure Search index. 

The flow collects inputs and performs several steps. The diagram below depicts the logical operations that the flow performs.

![n9s08385.png](../../media/n9s08385.png)


>>{: .note } AI Studio also includes an integrated vector search feature. We did not specify the use of the integrated vector search feature for this lab because we cannot deploy a flow that uses the feature to a container at this time.

### Description

In this task, you will import a pre-built flow, configure flow settings, and then test the flow.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Import a pre-built flow into the project.
1. Configure the flow.
1. Test the flow


### Success Criteria

- You have imported and configured a pre-built flow.
- You have tested the flow and confirmed that the flow returns appropriate results.
