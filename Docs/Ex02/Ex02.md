# Exercise 02: Create a Fabric workspace and data pipeline

## Lab Scenario


The legacy Contoso Hotel app was written by using Python code. App components run inside a Docker container. The app can connect to a SQL Server or PostgreSQL database (on-premises or online). In this exercise, you will deploy the legacy app to a Docker container and then run the container. You will provision a PostgreSQL database instance on Azure. You will setup and review the app, and then test the app by adding a new booking.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Clone a GitHub repository to your local machine
- Build a Docker container for app components
- Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance to store Docker containers
- Push the Docker container for the app to ACR
- Provision a PostgreSQL database in Azure to support the app
- Run the containerized app and populate the database
- Review the legacy Contoso Hotel app and add a booking

## Lab Duration

Estimated time to complete this exercise: *50 minutes*
